Nicee to have for Version 2:
- Improve on automated logging using logger function
- Give the user a parameter to define top X% for highly expressed genes.
- Add mapping of peptides to transcriptome
- The MHCpan output seems to have quite some duplicates, because of this a final check should be implemented to
1. Look if there's duplicates in our top candidate list
2. Look if the peptides' comes up multiple times and log their originating transcripts.


Nicee to have overall:
- Possibly migrate to snake make
- The paper (Mudge et. al. 2022) also removes <16AA , unmapped ORFs & non-AUG ORFs, this could also be implemented
- add possibility for different distance metrics to be used to decide for conflation (e.g. Levenshtein distance), this could be achieved with the jellyfish library
- Make parameter for user to define what kind of binders to safe. Method itself is ready, parameters not, however.
